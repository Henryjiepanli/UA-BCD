# UA-BCD

The official implementation of **"Overcoming the Uncertainty Challenges in Detecting Building Changes from Remote Sensing Images"**.

We are delighted to share that our paper has been successfully accepted by the **ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS 2024)**.

This repository contains the full implementation of our model, including training, testing, and a large-scale inference framework.

## üß™ Testing Instructions

To evaluate the trained UA-BCD model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the model is properly trained and paths are set.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python test.py --data_name LEVIR --batchsize 32

## üåç Large-Scale Inference Instructions

For large-scale applications of UA-BCD, use the following steps:

Specify the paths to the pre-change and post-change images, along with the model paths.

Run the inference script:

   ```bash
   python inference.py --uabcd_model <path_to_uabcd_model> \
                    --eue_model <path_to_eue_model> \
                    --A_path <path_to_pre_change_image> \
                    --B_path <path_to_post_change_image> \
                    --Pos XX --batchsize 64
